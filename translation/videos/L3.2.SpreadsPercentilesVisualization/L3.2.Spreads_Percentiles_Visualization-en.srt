00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
INSTRUCTOR: So far, we have analyzed the single variable,

1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,320
students' heights.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,480
This type of analysis is called univariate analysis, which

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,920
has a goal to describe and summarize the variables

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,210
characteristics using descriptive statistics,

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,210
things like mean, median, standard deviation,

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,530
and visualizations, plots such as histograms and box plots.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,030
In bivariate analysis, we explore two variables

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,280
and their relationship.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,710
And in multivariate analysis, we look at three or more variables

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,400
simultaneously and again, try to understand

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,530
their, this time, more complex, potentially, relationships.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,160
So let's move from our univariate analysis

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,880
of students' heights to bivariate analysis, which

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,800
in addition to the heights data, also includes students' weights.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,270
Now, we have two observational variables.

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,420
And it is interesting to quantify

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,290
the relationship between them--

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,810
that is, to measure how the variables covary.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,020
Weights, and heights are related to each other.

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,700
Taller students tend to weigh more than shorter students.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,480
We can plot that, one variable on the x-axis

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,210
and the other on the y-axis.

23
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,540
This kind of plot is called a scatter plot.

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,980
Each dot represents one student.

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,050
The great thing about scatter plots

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,970
is that they help us see patterns,

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,830
how the two variables relate to each other.

28
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,310
In the figure, we can observe an increasing pattern

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,230
from left to right.

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,560
This means that weights and heights are positively

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,560
correlated with each other.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,780
This type of relationship is also

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,940
called an association in bivariate analysis.

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,840
A linear association means the points form more or less

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,230
a straight line.

36
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,210
However, we can also observe non-linear associations,

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,030
such as quadratic patterns.

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,150
And sometimes there is no clear patterns,

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,150
as we can see in the figure.

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,820
In addition to the form of the association,

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,170
we also care about the direction.

42
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,540
If the slope of the line is upward,

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,530
it means the association is positive.

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,360
If the slope is downward, the association is negative.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,350
We also care about the strength of the association.

46
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,860
If the points are tightly clustered around the line,

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,890
it is a strong association.

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,690
If the points are more spread out, the association is weak.

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,810
It is important to note that strength does not

50
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,240
depend on direction.

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,850
You can have a strong positive or

52
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,600
a strong negative association.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,710
We can also quantify both the strength and direction

54
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,290
of a linear association using the correlation coefficient,

55
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,270
which ranges from minus 1 to 1.

56
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,090
The closer the value is to 1 or minus 1,

57
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,470
the stronger the linear relationship.

58
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,920
A value near 0 means there is little or no linear association.

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,450
For instance, a strong positive correlation might be around 0.9.

60
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,720
If the variables are unrelated, we

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,070
might see something like 0.01.

62
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,910
However, we should keep in mind that correlation does not

63
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,950
imply causation.

64
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,440
Just because two things move together

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,100
does not mean that one causes the other.

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,640
Even in our example, where height and weight are related,

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,960
the relationship is not directly causal.

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,380
Yes, they are correlated, but height does not directly

69
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,380
cause weight.

70
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,089
Instead, shared underlying factors like age, nutrition,

71
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:24,110
and biology influence both.

72
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,350
We can also use covariance to measure how

73
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,780
two variables vary together.

74
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,000
The covariance is positive if they

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,730
increase or decrease together.

76
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,840
It is negative if one increases while the other decreases.

77
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,900
And the covariance is near 0 if there is no consistent pattern.

78
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,310
Both covariance and correlation are summary statistics

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,310
that describe how two sets of observations

80
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,170
relate to each other.

81
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,120
Covariance gives us the direction of the relationship,

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,140
but not the strength in a meaningful way,

83
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,590
while correlation helps us quantify

84
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,450
both direction and strength of a linear relationship.

85
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,580
Now, let's talk about a classic statistical phenomenon,

86
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,220
Simpson's paradox.

87
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,430
Suppose we collect data on student height

88
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,630
and how many points they score in basketball.

89
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,280
When we look at the overall data,

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,590
it might appear that these two variables are negatively

91
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,740
correlated.

92
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,918
That is, taller students seem to score fewer points.

93
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,830
Hm.

94
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,410
However, when we separate the data

95
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,140
into two subgroups, male and female,

96
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,140
we may find that within each group,

97
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,060
taller students tend to score more points.

98
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,880
So the overall data suggests a negative correlation,

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,800
but the subgroup data reveals positive correlations

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,530
in both groups.

101
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,900
What does that mean?

102
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,680
It means that there is another factor, another variable--

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,580
in this case, gender--

104
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,690
that influences the observed relationship.

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,250
This variable is called the confounding variable.

106
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,770
In terms of terminology, we refer

107
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,420
to height as the independent variable and basketball points

108
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,390
as the dependent variable.

109
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,270
So the essence of the Simpson's paradox

110
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,780
is that if we ignore subgroups, like gender, in this case,

111
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,900
the overall trend might be misleading.

112
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,530
In other words, a trend that appears

113
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,570
in different groups of data disappears or reverses

114
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,840
when the groups are combined.

115
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,030
It's a statistical illusion caused

116
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,870
by these lurking or confounding variables that affect

117
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,540
the observed relationship.

118
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,270
This paradox is another important reminder

119
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,200
that correlation does not imply causation.

120
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,470
Now, contrast that with a classic example

121
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,430
of a spurious correlation.

122
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,600
Ice cream sales and shark attacks.

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,340
These two variables are correlated.

124
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,780
But does eating ice cream cause shark attacks?

125
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,480
Of course not.

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,360
The real explanation is a third factor.

127
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,320
Hot weather increases both ice cream sales and beach

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,070
activity, which, in turn, raises the chances of shark attacks.

129
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,180
This is what we call a spurious or misleading correlation, when

130
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,560
two variables appear related, but the connection is actually

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,890
driven by an external factor.

132
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,340
To sum up from today's lecture, we

133
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,980
talked about how to visualize data

134
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,470
with histograms, box plots, and scatter plots,

135
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,050
and explored key ideas like central tendency, spread,

136
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,950
and relationships between variables.

137
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,840
So far, we've looked at how variables can be associated--

138
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,740
not just the direction, but also the form and strength

139
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,540
of those relationships.

140
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,380
Then we moved into correlation and covariance

141
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,370
as tools to quantify those patterns.

142
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,340
In the end, statistics isn't just about calculating numbers.

143
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,360
It is about making decisions under uncertainty

144
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,159
and doing it in a way that's careful, clear, and transparent.

145
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
See you in the next lecture.
